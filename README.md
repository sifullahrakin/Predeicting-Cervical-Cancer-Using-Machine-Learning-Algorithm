# Predeicting-Cervical-Cancer-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This is a Machine Learning project work where I developed a model which can predict cervical cancer. For this project I used Python and some python libraries. Here I use xg-boost classifier. XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on the gradient boosting framework, which combines multiple weak prediction models (often decision trees) to create a strong ensemble model. Here I use a dataset from 858 patients at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas.
